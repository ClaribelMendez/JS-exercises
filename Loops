// Week 2 - Loops

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let counter1 = 1;

while (counter1 < 6){
console.log(counter1);
counter1++;
}

// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let counter2 = 0;

do{
counter2++;
console.log(counter2);
}
while (counter2 < 5);


// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

for (let counter3 = 1; counter3 < 6; counter3++){
console.log(counter3);
}

// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

let counter4 = 10;
while (counter4 > 0){
console.log(counter4);
counter4--;
}

let i = 11;
do{
i--;
console.log(i);
}
while (i > 1);


for (let j = 10; j > 0; j--){
console.log(j)
}


// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

let counter5 = 7;
while (counter5 < 28){
console.log(counter5);
counter5++
}

let counterFive = 6;
do{
counterFive++;
console.log(counterFive);
}
while (counterFive < 27);

for (let a = 7; a < 28; a++){
console.log(a);
}

// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

let counter6 = 10;
while (counter6 < 101){
console.log(counter6);
counter6 += 10;
}

let counterSix = 0;
do{
counterSix += 10;
console.log(counterSix);
}
while (counterSix < 100);

for (let b = 10; b < 101; b += 10){
console.log(b);
}

// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

// let counterFour = 1;
// while (counterFour < 2) {
//  console.log("HELP ME!");
//  counterFour--;
// }

// It will be an infinite loop because counterFour will ALWAYS be less than 2 as this loop is using a decrement operator.
// The correct loop should be:
let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour < 2 && counterFour > -101) {
  console.log("HELP ME!");
  counterFour--;
 }

// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.

let counter = -1;
let c = 9;
do{
counter++;
console.log(counter);
}
while(counter < c);

// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)

let favInt = 47;
for (let counterNine = 0; counterNine < 101; counterNine++){
if (counterNine !== favInt){
console.log(counterNine + " not my favorite number");
} else {
console.log(counterNine + " my favorite number!")
}
}

// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:

// A  while loop is used when the value isn't known ahead of time.
// A do...while loop would be used when I want the condition to execute at least once.
// A for loop would be used when I know how many times I want the loop to run

// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) {
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter > 0; insideCounter-- ) {
    console.log("inside", insideCounter);
  }
  console.log("***********************************");
}

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
// It was fairly easy, I mainly had to search for how to write the loops and review when to use each one so that I understand clearly.
// I used MDN, Stackoverflow, Freecodecamp and different google searches.
