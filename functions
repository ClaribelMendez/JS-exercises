// Week 3 - Functions

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Define a function called logGreeting() that prints the string “Hello!” (use console.log).
// Underneath the function, write the line of code that runs the function.

function logGreeting() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
logGreeting()

// Exercise 2. Define a function called getName() that *returns* a string that is your name.
// Remember, this function should return the string -- not print it.
// Then print your name in the console by passing getName() into the console.log() function.

function getName() {
  return "Claribel";
}
console.log(getName())

// Exercise 3. Call a function within a function -- Write a function called logGreeting2()
// that prints a full sentence that contains your name: "Hello! My name is <name>."
// logGreeting2 should call myName() to get your name.
// Then print your greeting to the console by calling logGreeting2().

function logGreeting2() {
  let myName = getName()
  console.log("Hello! My name is " + myName + ".")
}
logGreeting2()

// Exercise 4. Write a function that takes 3 parameters that are all numbers.
// The function should return the sum of the 3 numbers.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.
function sumOf(num1, num2, num3) {
  return num1 + num2 + num3
}
console.log(sumOf(1, 3, 5));
console.log(sumOf(10, 20, 30));
console.log(sumOf(7, 8, 9));

// Exercise 5. Let's say a museum gives a discount for children ages 14 or under, and seniors 65 or older.
// Write a function that takes in a person's age and returns true if they should get a discount.
// Otherwise it should return false.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.
function discount(num) {
  if (num <= 14 || num >= 65) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
console.log(discount(5));
console.log(discount(14));
console.log(discount(35));
console.log(discount(65));
console.log(discount(90));

// Exercise 6. Write a function that takes 2 parameters -- one number and one string.
// The function should print the string the given number of times.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function stringTimesNum(string, num) {
  console.log(string.repeat(num))
};
stringTimesNum("This string is repeating three times ", 3);
stringTimesNum("This string is repeating twice ", 2);
stringTimesNum("This string doesn't repeat", 1);
stringTimesNum("This string doesn't exist", 0);



// Exercise 7. Read the following code (don't run it yet)
function mysteryFunction1(p1) {
  return p1 * 2;
}
const y = 4;
const z = mysteryFunction1(y);
console.log("The value of y is " + y);
console.log("The value of z is " + z);

// Without running the code, write down in a comment:
// 1. What mysteryFunction1 does ==> returns the result of the input times 2
// 2. What prints out for the value of y ==> console.log("The value of y is " + y)
// 3. What prints out for the value of z ==> the function mysteryFunction1()
// Now run the code and see if you're correct.
// Were you correct? If not, what did you learn? I wasn not correct for the question what prints out the value of z. I learned that that the function can
// be called back in this way.

// Exercise 8. Read the following code (don't run it yet)
function mysteryFunction2(p1, p2) {
  const x = p1 - p2;
  return x;
}
const a = mysteryFunction2(10, 4);
const b = mysteryFunction2(a, 1);
console.log("The value of a is " + a);
console.log("The value of b is " + b);

// Without running the code, write down in a comment:
// 1. What mysteryFunction2 does ==> returns the value of p1 minus p2 that was stored in const x variable
// 2. What prints out for the value of a ==> 6
// 3. What prints out for the value of b ==> 5
// Now run the code and see if you're correct.
// Were you correct? If not, what did you learn? Yes, I was correct.

// Exercise 9. This exercise is to practice reading the documentation for functions.
// String.split() is a function in the JavaScript standard library that you can use in your code.
// Read about the split() function here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
// Try to use it to solve the following challenges:

// Here's a string I made representing my grocery list.
// Using split() and groceryList, make an array of my grocery list items
const groceryList = "eggs,carrots,orange juice";
let arrayOfItems = groceryList.split(/[,]/)
console.log(arrayOfItems)

// Here's a string I made representing my morning schedule.
// Using split() and mySchedule, make an array of the *first 2* things I do in the morning
// There are multiple ways to do this, but try doing it using only the split() function.
const mySchedule = "wake up--->brush teeth--->eat breakfast-->go to work";
let firstTwoThingsInTheMorning = mySchedule.split("--->", 2)
console.log(firstTwoThingsInTheMorning)

// I found this mostly easy. I used the documentation provided in the pre-work + mdn
